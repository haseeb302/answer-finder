How to add data to json

1. Add the question object in questions array. 

2. Add options array if the question type is multiple.

3. Add resultCode to option object in options array to tell that this is the final question.

4. When resultCode is added to the option object in options array, 
then add the result object in results array with the same resultCode, 
and with a message to show back at the end.

5. Add parentQuestionId to make a question child of a question.

question: {
    "id": Number,
    "parentQuestionId", parentId,
    "question": "Question string",
    "type": "string | number | multiple",
    "required": "false | true"
    "options": [
        { "key": "No", "value": 0, "resultCode": 1 },
        { "key": "Yes", "value": 1, "resultCode": 2 }
    ],
},

result {
    id: Number,
    resultCode: Number,
    message: "Message to show",
}
